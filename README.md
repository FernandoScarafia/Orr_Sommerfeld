# Orr_Sommerfeld
It is a python library developed in order to solve the Orr Sommerfeld equations.

Fluid systems are often described and characterized by their stability or receptivity behavior. Perturbations of infinitesimal amplitude that grow when superimposed on an equilibrium state of the flow render the base flow unstable.

The Orr–Sommerfeld equation, is an eigenvalue equation describing the linear two-dimensional or three-dimensional modes of disturbance to a viscous parallel flow. The solution to the Navier–Stokes equations for a parallel, laminar flow can become unstable if certain conditions on the flow are satisfied, and the Orr–Sommerfeld equation determines precisely what the conditions for hydrodynamic stability are.
